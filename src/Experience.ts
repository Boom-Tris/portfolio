        As the website administrator for the Ban Tak Police Station’s official website, I manage and maintain the platform using WordPress. My responsibilities include updating news and announcements, ensuring content accuracy, optimizing the site for performance and accessibility, and implementing security best practices to protect sensitive public information. I also collaborate with officers to ensure that the website serves as a reliable and user-friendly communication channel between the station and the local community.

        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">September 2024</p>
        <p class="text-gray-200">
       I developed a prototype system for detecting elderly falls using computer vision and artificial intelligence. Leveraging Python-based libraries and the YOLOv11 object detection model, the system accurately identifies instances of human falls in real-time video feeds. When a fall is detected, the system immediately triggers an audible alert to notify caregivers or nearby individuals. The project focused on real-time performance, minimizing false positives, and ensuring ease of deployment in home or community settings. This demo highlights the practical use of AI in improving safety and well-being for the elderly population.
